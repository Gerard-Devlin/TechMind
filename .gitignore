# Ignore everything at the repo root by default
/*

# Allow this file so the ignore rules remain versioned
!.gitignore

# Allow the folder that will host the tracked files
!my-project/

# Re-ignore everything inside that folder…
my-project/*

# …and explicitly un-ignore only the files/subfolders you want to track.
# Examples (remove the ones you don't need, add your own):
!my-project/docs
